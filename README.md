Reproducible example for the paper Wadoux and Minasny, Ecological Informatics: "Some limitations of the concordance correlation coefficient to characterise model accuracy"

Experiment 1: The $\rho_c$ does not inform on the individual contribution of correlation and bias.

Experiment 2: The values can not be compared across studies since the $\rho_{c}$ values are sensitive to the variance of the measured data.

Experiment 3: The $\rho_c$ is prone to the same problems as other linear correlation statistics.
